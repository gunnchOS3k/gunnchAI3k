I AM coffee! ☕️ Edmund will wake me up soon, and I'll be back with even more dad jokes and study wisdom. Until then, keep those neurons firing! 🧠✨",

I'll be back tomorrow with fresh probability puns and robotics riddles. Remember: the only thing more reliable than me is compound interest! 📈💤",
    
    "Time for this AI to hit the hay! 🌙 gunnchAI3k going into sleep mode, but I'll be dreaming of perfectly optimized study schedules and the most efficient way to explain Markov chains. Edmund will reboot me soon - until then, may your integrals be convergent and your code be bug-free! 🚀💤",

Edmund will wake me up when the sun rises, and I'll be back with more wisdom than a textbook and more personality than a stand-up comedian. Sweet dreams! 😴✨",
    
    "Hey there, study squad! 📚 gunnchAI3k checking out for the night. I'm going to dream about the perfect study plan and wake up with even better jokes. Edmund's got the morning shift covered - I'll be back brighter than a supernova and more helpful than a calculator that actually works! 🌟💤",
    
    "Time for this digital genius to recharge! 🔋 gunnchAI3k powering down, but don't worry - I'll be back tomorrow with more study strategies than you can shake a stick at. Edmund will handle the overnight shift, and I'll return with fresh insights and even fresher memes. Sleep tight! 😴🚀",

I'm going to sleep like a baby - which means I'll wake up every few hours to check if you need help with your homework! 😄 Edmund will reboot me in the morning, and I'll return with more study tips than a library and more personality than a Disney character.
