# ðŸ§  Jarvis Demo Guide - How to Use Your Omniscient Study Copilot

## ðŸš€ Quick Start Guide

Now that Jarvis is running, here's how to use your new omniscient study copilot:

### 1. Start a Jarvis Study Session
```
/jarvis start course:"Calculus I" syllabus:"syllabus.pdf" assignment:"hw1.pdf" lecture:"lecture3.pptx" hours-per-week:10
```

**What this does:**
- Creates a comprehensive study session for Calculus I
- Analyzes your syllabus, assignment, and lecture materials
- Generates a personalized study plan
- Creates PPTX/DOCX/PDF study materials
- Sets up your 30-minute daily focus

### 2. Compute Math Problems
```
/jarvis compute expression:"d/dx(x^2 + 3x + 2)"
```

**What this does:**
- Uses Wolfram Alpha for precise computation
- Shows step-by-step solution
- Provides source attribution
- Caches results for cost efficiency

### 3. Research Topics with Citations
```
/jarvis research query:"calculus applications in physics"
```

**What this does:**
- Uses Perplexity API for research
- Returns answer with proper citations
- Shows confidence score
- Provides multiple high-quality sources

### 4. Guided Learning Mode
```
/jarvis assignment-mode topic:"derivatives"
```

**What this does:**
- Creates scaffolded learning experience
- Attempt â†’ Hint â†’ Step-by-Step â†’ Final
- No instant answer dumps
- Promotes understanding over memorization

### 5. Practice with Retrieval Quizzes
```
/jarvis quiz topic:"integration" items:5
```

**What this does:**
- Generates retrieval practice questions
- Promotes active recall
- Uses spaced repetition principles
- Builds long-term retention

### 6. Check for Updates
```
/jarvis update
```

**What this does:**
- Shows latest improvements from top education tools
- Displays new features and integrations
- Updates from OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, Perplexity, Wolfram, Khan Academy

### 7. Configure Settings
```
/jarvis settings local-mode:true cloud-lookups:false
```

**What this does:**
- Enables local mode (no cloud lookups)
- Disables cloud research and computation
- Protects privacy for sensitive content
- Maintains academic integrity

1. **Start Session**: `/jarvis start course:"Physics I" syllabus:"physics_syllabus.pdf" assignment:"lab_report.pdf"`
2. **Compute Physics**: `/jarvis compute expression:"F = ma"`
3. **Research Topics**: `/jarvis research query:"quantum mechanics applications"`
4. **Practice**: `/jarvis quiz topic:"kinematics" items:6`
5. **Guided Learning**: `/jarvis assignment-mode topic:"momentum conservation"`

### For a Research Project:
1. **Start Session**: `/jarvis start course:"Research Methods" syllabus:"research_syllabus.pdf"`
2. **Research Literature**: `/jarvis research query:"qualitative research methods"`
3. **Compute Statistics**: `/jarvis compute expression:"t-test calculation"`
4. **Practice**: `/jarvis quiz topic:"research design" items:10`
5. **Guided Learning**: `/jarvis assignment-mode topic:"data analysis"`
